# GestureControl
Worked on gesture control and made few implementations to experience and understand how it would change the way we use things.

I have developed 3 projects, 

Finger counter - Detecting the hand and counting the number of fingers open

Volume controller - Control the system volume using gesture 

Mouse controller - move, click, double click the mouse using gesture
Usage of mouse controller :
1. only index finger open to move around
2. Raise the middle finger to freeze the mouse, at the location you want to click on
3. to click, move the thumb towards the index finger.

I have made a module name HandModule which tracks the hand gesture using MEDIAPIPE library.
I have imported this module in all the 3 projects
