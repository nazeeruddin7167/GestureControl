# GestureControl
Worked on gesture control and made few implementations to experience and understand how it would change the way we use things. 
I have developed 3 projects, 
Finger counter - Detecting the hand and counting the number of fingers open
Volume controller - Control the system volume using gesture 
Mouse controller - move, click, double click the mouse using gesture

I have made a module name HandModule which tracs the hand using MEDIAPIPE.
I have imported this module in all the 3 projects
